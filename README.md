## Setup (WebView branch only)

Until the new `Sahha.getToken()` is implemented, the profile token will have to manually be added in.

1. Create a new `secrets.properties` file with the exact filename under `app/`

[//]: # (![step 1]&#40;setup/step1.png "Step 1"&#41;)

2. Fill in the `PROFILE_TOKEN` with your profile token

[//]: # (![step 2]&#40;setup/step2.png "Step 2"&#41;)

Then you should be all good to go :thumbsup:
